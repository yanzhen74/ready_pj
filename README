The file README and the project are created local.
Then create a same-name repo in github.

Let's see if this works:

$git remote add origin git@github.com:yanzhen74/ready_pj.git

oooooooops, my answer is no...

but this works:
$git remote add origin https://github.com/yanzhen74/read_pj.git

and use this command to upstream push:
$git push -u origin master
